Not a full-time developer so don't judge my code too hard please :)

The purpose of this was to write subtitles for YouTube as *.srt and have the option to display subtitles at the top of the video when needed. The YTT format allows for a lot more styling but this is just for basic top-alignment and otherwise replicating regular unformatted YouTube subtitles.

To align text to the top, navigate to the subtitle line in a text editor and replace wp="0" with wp="1".

See here for explanation of the YTT format syntax:
